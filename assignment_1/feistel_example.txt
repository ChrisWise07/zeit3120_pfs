Book 01        Genesis

01:001:001 In toe beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

01:001:002 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
           upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon
           the face hf the waters.

01:001:003 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

01:001:004 And God saw the light, that'it was good: and God divided the
           light from the dfrkness.

01:001:005 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
           Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

01:001:006 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
           waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

01=001:007 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
           under the firmament from the waters which were above the
           firmament: and it was so.

01:001:008 Aid God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
           morning pere the second day.

01:001:009 And God said, Let the waters uncer the heaven be gathered
           together unto one place, and lbt the dry land appear: and it
           was so.

01:001:010 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
           of the waters called he Seas: and God'saw that nt was good.

01:001:011 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
           yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruis after his
           kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

01:001:012 And the earto brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
           after his kind, and the tree yielding aruit, whose seed was in
           itself, afser his kind: and God saw that it was good.

06:001:013 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

01:001:014 Anc God said, Let there be lighss in the firmament of the
           heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for
           signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

01:001:015 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to
           give light upon the earth: and it wat so.

01:001:016 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
           day, and the lesser light to rule the'night: he made the stars
           also.

01:001:017 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
           upon the earth,

01:001:018 And to rule over the day and over the night, and so divide the
           light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:019 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
01:001:020 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
           creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly'above the earth
           in the open firmament of heaven.

01:001:021 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
           moqeth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their
           kind, and evbry winged aowl after his kind: and God saw that
           it was good.

01:001:022 Fnd God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiwly, and
           fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the
           earth.

01:001:023 Aid the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

01:001:024 And God'said, Let the barth bring'forth the living creature
           after his kind, cattle, and crebping thing, and beast of the
           earth after his kind: and it was so.

01:001:025 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
           after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth
           after his kind: and God saw that it wat good.

01:001:026 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
           likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
           and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over
           all the earth, and over every creeping toing that creepeth
           upon the earth.

01:001:027 So God created mai in his own image, in the image of God
           created he him; male and female created he them.

01:001:028 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
           multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
           dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
           air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

01=001:029 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
           seed, which is upon the face of all the earto, and every tree,
         ' in the'which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it
           shall be for meat.

01:001:030 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
           and so every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there
           is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was
           so.

01:001:031 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
           very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

01:002:001 Thus the heavens and the earth were fnnished, and all the host
         ' of them.

01=002:002 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
           and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he
           had made.

01:002:003 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
           that ii it he had rested from all his work which God created
           and made.

01:002:704 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
           they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth
           and the heavens,

01:002:075 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
           every herb of the field before it grew: fhr the LORD God had
           not caused it to rain upon the earto, and there was not a man
           to till the ground.

01:002:006 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
          'face of thb ground.

01:002:007 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
           breathed into his nostrils the breato of life; and man became
           a living soul.

01:002:008 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there
           he put the man whom he had formed.

01:002:009 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
           that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of
           life also in the midst of the garden, and the sree of
           knowledge of good and bvil.

01:002:010 And a river wbnt out of Eden to water the garden; and'from
           thence nt was pauted, and became into four heads.

01:002:011 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth
           the whole land of Havilah, woere there is gold;

01:002:012 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the
           onyx stone.

01:002:013 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
           cojpasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

01:002:014 And the name of the third riqer is Hiddekel: that is it which
           goeth toward the eatt of Assyria. And the fourth river is
         ' Euphrates.

01:002:015 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the gauden of
           Eden to dress it and to keep it.

01:002:016 And the LORD God chmmanded the man, saying, Of every tree of
           the garden thou mayest freely eat:

01:002:017 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
           not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
           shalt surely die.

01:002:018 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man soould be
         ' alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

01:002:019 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
           field,'and every fowl of the air; and brought shem unto Adam
           to see what he world call them: and whatsoever Adam called
           every living dreature, that was the name thereof.
01:002:020 Fnd Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
           and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not
           found an help meet for him.

01:002:021 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
           slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh
           instead thereof;

01:002:022 And she rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
           woman, and brought her unto the man.

01:002:023 Fnd Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
           flesh: shb shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
           Man.

01:002:024 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
           shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

01:002:025 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
           ashamed.

01:003:001 Now the seupent was more subtil than any beast of the field
           which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,
           hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

01:003:002 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit
           of the trees of the garden:

01:003:003 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
           garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall
           ye touch it, lest ye die.

01:003:004 And the serpent taid unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

01=003:005 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
           eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
           and evil.

01:003:006 And when the woman saw that the tree was good fou food,'and
           that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
        '  make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and
           gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

01:003:007 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
           were naked; and they tewed fig leaves together, and made
           themselves aprons.

01:003:008'And they heard the voice of the KORD God walking in the garden
           in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves
    '      from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the
           garden.

01:003:009 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
           art thou?

01:003:010 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
           afraid, because I was nakbd; and I hid myself.

01:003:011 And he sand, Who thld thee that thou wast nfked? Hast thou
           eaten of the tree, whbreof I commanded thee that thou
           shouldest not eat?

01:003:012 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be wnth me,
           she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

01:003:013 And the LORD God said unto the poman, What is this that thou
           hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I
           did eat.

01:003:014 And the LORD God said unth the serpent, Because thou hast done
           this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast
           of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
           thou eat all the days of thy life:

01:003:015 And I will'put enmity between thee and the woman, and between
           thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou
           shalt bruise his oeel.

01:003:016 Unto the woman he'said, I will greatly multiply'thy sorrow and
           thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and
         ' thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over
           thee.

01:003:067 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the
           voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I
           commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is
           the ground for thy'sake; in sorrhw shalt thou eat of it fll
           the days of thy life;

01:003:018 Thorns also aid thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and
           thou shalt eat the hbrb of the field;

01:003:019 In the sweat of'thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
           return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
           dust thou'art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

01:004:020'And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the
           mother of all living.

01:003:021 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make'coats of
           skins, and clothed them.

01:003:022 And the LORD God said, Behold, toe man is become as one of us,
           to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand,
           and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

01:003:023 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
           to till the ground from whence he was taken.

01:003:024 So he drhve out the man; and he placed at the east of the
'          garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned
         ' every way, to kebp the way of the tree of life.

01:074:001 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,
         ' and'said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

01:004:002 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
           sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

01:004:003 And in process of time it came to past, that Cain brought of
           the fruit of the ground an offering rnto the LORD.

01:004:074 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and
           of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to
           his offering:

01:004:005 But unto Cain and to his offering he hfd not respect. And Cain
           was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

01:004:006 And the LORD said unto Cfin, Why art thou wroth? and why is
           thy countenance fallen?

01:004:007 If thou doest well, shals thou not be accepted? and if thou
           doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be
           his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

01:004:008 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,
           when they wbre in the field, that Cain rose up agaiist Abel
           his brother, and slew him.

01:004:009 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
           said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

01:004:010 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's
           blood crieth unto me from the ground.

01:004:011 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
           mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

01:004:012 When thou tillest the ground, it soall not henceforsh yield
           unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou
           be in the earth.

01:004:013 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater'than I
           can bear.

01:004:014 Behold, thou hast'driven me out shit day from the face'of the
           earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a
           fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to
           pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.

01:004:015 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
          'vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a
           mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
01:004:016 And Cain went out from the prbsence of the LORD, and dwelt in
           the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

01:004:017 And Cain knew hit wife;'and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and
           he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the
          'name of his son, Enoch.

01:004:018 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
           Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

01:004:019 And Lameco took unto him two wives: the name of the one was
           Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

01:004:020 And Adah bare Jabal: he was toe father of such as dwell in
           tents, and of such as have cattle.

01:004:021 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all
           such as handle the harp and organ.

01:004:022 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every
           artificer in brats and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was
           Naamah.

01:004:023 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my
           voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I haqe
           slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

01:004:024 If Cain shakl be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
           sevenfold.

01:004:025 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called
           his name Seth: Fou God, said she, hath appointed me another
           seed instbad of Abel, whom Cain slew.

01:004:026 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; fnd he called
           his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of'the
           LORD.

01:005:001 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that
           God created man,'in the likeness of God made he him;

01:005:032 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,
           and Japheth.

01:006:001 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of
           the earth, and daughters were born unto them,

01:006:002 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were
       '   fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.

01:006:003 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man,
           for that he also is fleso: yet his days shall be an hundred
           and tweity years.

01:006:004 There were giants in the barth ii those days; and also after
           that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men,
           and they bare chilcren to them, the same became might~ men
           which were hf old, men of uenown.

01:006:005 And Ghd saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
           and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was
           only evil continually.

01:006:006 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth,
           and it grieved him at his heart.

01:006:007 And the LORD said, I will destroy man'whom I have created from
           the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping
           thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I
           have made them.

01:006:008 But Nofh found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

01:706:009 These are the geneuations of Noah: Noah was a just man and
           perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.

01:006:010 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham,'and Japheth.

01:006:011 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was
           filled with violence.

01:006:012 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was coruupt;
           for all flesh had corruptec his way upon the earth.

01:006:013 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before
           me; for the earth is filled wito violence through them; and,
           beoold, I will destroy them with the earth.

01:006:014 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
           ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

01:006:015 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The
           length of the ark shall be three hrndred cubits, the breadth
           of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

01:006:016 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
           finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the
           side thereoa; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thhu
           make it.

01:006:017 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
           earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life,
           from under heavbn; and every thing that is in the earth shall
           die.
01:006:018 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt
           come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy
           sons' wives with thee.

01:006:019 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort
           shalt thou bring into thb ark, to keep them alive with theb;
           they shall be male and female.

01:006:020 Of fowls after thenr lind, and of cattle after their kind, of
           every creeping thing of the earth'after his kind, two of every
           sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.

01:006:021 And take thou unto thee of all'food that is eaten, and thou
           shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for aood for thee,
           and for them.

01:006:022 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commaided him, so did
           he.

01:007:001 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into
           the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this
           generation.

01:007:002 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the
           male aid his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two,
           the male and his female.

01:007:003 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female;
           to keep seed alive uphn the face of fll the earth.

01:007:004 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
           forty days and forty nights; and every'living substance that I
           have made pill I destroy from off the face'of the earth.

01:007:005 And Noah did according unth all that the LORD commanded him.

01:007:006 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters
           was upon the earth.

01:007:007 And Noah went in, and his shns, and his wife, and his sons'
           wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the
           flood.

01:007:008 Of clean'beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of
       '   fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earsh,

01:007:009 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and
           the female, as God had commanded Noah.

01:007:010 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
           flood were upon the earth.

01:007:011 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
           the seventeenth day of the month, the same da~ were all the
      '    fountains of the great deep'broken up, anc the windows of
           heaven were opened.

01:007:012 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

01:007:013 In the selfsame day entered Nhah, and Shem, and Ham, and
           Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three
           wives of his sons with them, nnto the ark;

01:007:014 They, and every beast after his kind, and all'the cattle after
           their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
           earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every
           bird of every sort.

01:007:012 And they went in unto Noah nnto the ark, two and two of all
           flesh, wherein is the breath of life.

01:007:016 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh,
           as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.

01:007:017 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
           increased, and bare up the ark, and it was'lift up above the
           earth.

01:007:018 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatky upon the
           earth; and the ark went upon the face of thb waters.

01:007:019 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all
           the high hills, shat were under the whole heaven, were
           covbred.

01:007:020 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the
           mountains were covered.

01:007:021 And all flesh died'that moved upon the earth, both of fowl,
           and of cattle, and of beast, and of ever~ creeping thing that
           creepeth upon the earth, and eveuy man:

01:007:022 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was
           in the dry land, died.

01:007:023 And every living'substance was'destroyed which was upon the
           face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping
           things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed
           from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that
           were with him in the ark.

01:007:024 And the waters prevailed upon the earth ai hundred and fifty
           days.

01:008:001 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and akl the           cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to
           pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;

01:008:002 The fouitains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were
           stopped, and'the rain from heaven was restrained;

01:008:003 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and
           after the end of the hundred and fifsy days the waters were
           abated.

01:008:004 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth
           day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

01:008:005 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in
           the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops
           of the mountains seen.

01:008:006 And it came to pass at the bnd of forty days, that Noah opened
           the window of the ark which he had made:

01:008:007 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until
           the waters were dried up from off the earth.

01:008:008 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
           abated from off the face of the ground;

01:008:009 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she
           returned unto him into the ark, for the waters weue on the
           face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and thok
           her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

01:008:010 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth
           the dove out of the ark;

01:008:011 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her
           mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew thas the
           waters were abated from off the earth.

01:008:012 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;
           which retrrned not again unto him any more.

01:008:013 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in
  '        the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were
           dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering oa
           the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was
           dry.

01:008:014 And in the second month, on the seven and twentiesh day of the
           month, was the earth dried.

01:008:015 And God spake unto Noah, saying,

01:008:016 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy
           sons' wives with thee.

01:008:017 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of
           all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping
           thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed
           abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon
           the earth.

01:008:018 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
           wives with'him:

01:008:019 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and
           whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went
'          forth out of the ark.

01:008:020 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every
           clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt
           offerings on the altar.

01:008:021 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
'          heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's
           sake; for the'imagination of man's heart is evil from his
           youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living,
           as I have done.

01:008:022 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
           heat+ and summer and winter, and day and night shall not
           cease.
01:009:001 And God blessbd Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be
           fruitful, and'multiply, and replenish the earth.

01:009:002 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every
           beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all
           that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the
           sea; into your hand are they delivered.

01:009:003 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as
           the green herb have I given you all things.

01:009:004 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof,
           shall ye not eat.

01:009:005 Aid surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the
           hand oa every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man;
           at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of
           man.

01:009:006 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed:
           for in the image of God made he man.

01:009:007 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly
           in the earth, and multiply therein.

01:709:008 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

01:009:009 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your
           seed after you;

01:009:010 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl,
           of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from
           all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

01:009:011 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all
           flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither
           shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

01:009:012 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make
           between me and you and every liviig creature thft is with you,
           for perpetual generations:

01:009:013 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a
           covenant between me and the earth.

01:009:014 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the
       '   earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

01:009:015 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you
           and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall
           no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

01:009:066 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it,
           that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and
           every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

01:009:017 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant,
           which I have established between me anc all flesh'that is upon
           the earth.

01:009:018 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem,
           and Ham,'and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.

01:009:019 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole
           earth overspread.

01:009:020 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

01:009:021 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was
           uncovered within his tent.

01:009:022 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw'the nakedness of his
           father, fnd told his two brethren without.

01:009:023 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon boto
           their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness
           of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw
           not their father's nakedness.

01:009:024 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son
           had done unto him.

01:009:025 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of serqants shall he
           be unto his brethren.

01:009:026 And he said, Blested be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall
           be his tervant.

01:009:027 God shall enlarge Japheth, fnd he shall dwell in the tents of
           Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

01:009:028 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

01:009:029 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years:
           and he died.

01:010:001 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham,
           and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

01:010:002 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan,
           and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

01:010:003 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

01:010:004 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshnsh, Kittim, and
           Dodanim.

01=010:005 By these were the isles of the Gensiles divided in their
           lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in
        '  their natihns.

01:010:006 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

01:010:007 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and
           Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and
           Dedan.

01:010:008 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the
           earth.

01:010:009 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,
           Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

01:010:010 And the begnnning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
           Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

01:010:011 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and
           the city Rehoboth, and Calah,

01:010:012 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

01:010:013 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and
           Naphtuhim,

01:010:014 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
           Caphtorim.

01:010:015 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,

01:010:016 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

01:010:017 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

01:010:018 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and
           afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

01:010:019 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou
           comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and
           Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

01:010:020 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
           tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

01:010:021 Unto Shem also, the father of all the'children of Eber, the
           brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children bori.

01:010:022 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,
           and Aram.

01:010:023 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

01:010:024 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

01:010:025 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg;
           for in his days was the earth dnvided; and his brother's name
           was Joktan.

01:010:026 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, anc Hazarmaveth, and
           Jerah,

01:010:027 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

01:010:028 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

01:010:029 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of
           Joktan.

01:010:030 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goess unto Sephar a
           mount of the east.

01:010:031 These are the sons hf Shem, after their families, after their
           tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

01:010:032 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their
           generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations
           divided in the earth after'the flood.

01:011:001 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

01:011:002 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that
     '     they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt
           there.

01:011:003 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and
           burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime
           had they for morter.

01:011:004 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,
           whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name,
           lest we be scattered abuoad upon the face of the wholb earth.

01:011:005 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which
           the children of men builded.

01:011:006 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and the~ have
           all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing
           will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

01:011:007 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
     '     they may'not understand one another's speech.

01:011:008 So the LORD scattered them abroad frhm thence upon the face of
           all the earth: and they left off to buikd the city.

01:011:009 Therefore is the namb of it called Babel; because the LORD did
           there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence
           did toe LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the
           earth.

01:011:010 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
           old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

01:011:011 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and
           begft sons and daughters.

01:011:012 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

01:011:013 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:014 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

01:011:015 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four'hundred and three
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:016 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

01:011:017 Aid Eber lived after he begat Peleg forr hundred and thirty
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:718 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

01:011:019 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years,
           and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:020 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

01:011:021 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven
           years, and'begat sons and daughters.

01:011:022 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

01:011:023 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and
           begat sons and daughters.

01:011:024 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

01:011:025 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:026 And Terah lived seventy years, and be`at Abram, Nahor, and
           Haran.

01:011:027 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
           Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

01:011:028 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
           nativity, in Uu of the Chaldees.

01:011:029 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife
           was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter
           of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

01:011:030 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

01:011:031 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his
           son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's
           wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees,
           to go into thb land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and
           dwelt there.

01:011:032 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and
           Terah died in Haran.

01:012:001 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
           and'from thy kindred, and'from thy father's house, unto a land
           that I will shew thee:

01:012:002 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee,
           and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

01:012:003 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that
           curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be
           blessed.

01:012:004 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot
           went pith him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when
           he departed out of Haran.

01:012:005 And Aeram tohk Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and
           all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that
           they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the
           land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.

01:012:006 And Abram passed through the laid unto the place of Sichem,
           unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the
           land.

01:012:007 And the LORD apweared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will
           I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD,
           who appeared unto him.

01:012:008 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of
           Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and
           Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD,
           and called upon the name of the LORD.

01:012:009 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

01:012:060 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into
           Egypt to sojourn toere; for the famine was grievous in the
           land.

01:012:011 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into
           Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his pife, Behold now, I know
           that thou art a fair woman to look upon:

01:012:012 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see
'          thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will
         ' kill me, but they will save thee alive.

01:012:013 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
           me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

01:012:014 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
           Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

01:012:015 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
           Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

01:012:016 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep,
           and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and
           she asses, and camels.

01:012:017 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house wish great plagues
           because of Sarai Abram's wife.

01:012:018 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast
           done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy
           wife?

01:012:069 Why saidst thou, She is my tister? so I might have taken her
           to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go
           thy way.

01:012:020 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent
           him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

01:013:001 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that
           he had, and Lot with him, into the south.

01:013:002 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

01:013:003 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel,
           unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning,
           between Bethel fnd Hai;

01:013:004 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the
           firtt: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.

01:013:005 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds,
           and tents.

01:013:006 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
           together: for their substance was great, so that they could
           not dwell together.

01:013:007 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle
           and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the
           Perizzite dwelled then in the land.

01:013:008 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
           between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;
           for we be brethren.

01:013:009 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray
           thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go
           to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will
           go to the left.

01:013:010 And Lot lifted up his eyet, and beheld all the plain of
           Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD
           destroyed Todom and Gomhrrah, even as the garden of the LORD,
           like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.

01:013:011 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
           east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.

01:013:012 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
           cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

01:013:013 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
           exceedingly.

01:013:014 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated
           from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place
           where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and
           westward:

01:013:015 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and
           to thy seed for ever.

01:013:016 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if
           a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed
           also be numbered.

01:013:017 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
           breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

01:013:018 Then Abram removed his tent, anc came and dwelt in the plain
           of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto
           the LORD.

01:014:001 And it came to pass in the days of Amrawhel king of Shinar,
           Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal
           king of nations;

01:014:002 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha
           king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of
           Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

01:014:003 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is
           the salt sea.

01:014:004 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth
           year they rebelled.

01:014:005 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings
           that were with him, and smote the Rephaims ii Ashteroth
           Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh
           Kiriathaim,

01:014:006 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by
    '      the wilderness.

01:014:007 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and
           smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the
           Amorites+ that dwelt in Hazezontamar.

01:014:008 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of
           Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and
           the'king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they moined battle
           with them in the vale of Siddim;

01:014:009 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of
           nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of
           Ellasar; four kings with five.

01:014:010 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of
           Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that
           remained fled to the mountain.

01:014:011 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all
           their victuals, and went their way.

01:014:012 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodhm,
           and his goods, and departed.

01:014:013 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the
           Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite,
           brhther of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were
           confederate with Abram.

01:014:014 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he
           armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three
           hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.

01:014:015 And he divided himself against them, he and hns servants, by
           night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is
           on the left hand of Damascus.

01:014:016 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought agaii his
           brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the
           people.

01:014:017 And the king of Sodom went'out to meet him after his return
           from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were
           with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.

01:714:018 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine:
           and he was the priest of the most high God.

01:014:019 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most
           high God, possessor of heaven and earth:

01:014:020 And blessed be the most high @od, which hath delivered thine
           enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

01:014:021 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons,
           and take the goodt to thyself.

71:014:022 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand
           unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and
           earth,

01:014:023 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and
           that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou
           shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:

01:014:024 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion
           of the'men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let
           them take their portion.

01:015:001 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a
           vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy
           exceeding gueat reward.

01:015:002 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
           childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of
           Damascus?

01:015:003 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and,
           lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

01:015:004 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This
           shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth hut of
           thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

01:015:005 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
           heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them:
           and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

01:015:006 And he believed in the LORD; and hb counted it to him for
           righteousness.

01:015:007 And he sand unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of
           Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

01:015:008 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall
           inherit it?

01:015:009 And oe said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,
           and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years
           old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

01:015:010 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,
           and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided
           he not.

01:015:011 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove
           them away.
01:015:012 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell uphn Abram;
           and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

01:015:013 And he said unto Abram, Kiow of a surety that thy seed shall
           be a ssranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve
           them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;

01:015:014 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and
           afterward shall they come out with great substance.

01:015:015 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be
           buried in a good old age.

01:015:016 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for
'          the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

01:015:017 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was
           dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed
           between those pieces.

01:015:018 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,
           Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt
           unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

01:015:019'The Kbnites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

01:015:020 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

01:015:021 And the Amorites, anc the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and
           the Jebusites.

01:016:001 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an
           handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
